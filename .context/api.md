# API

* Whenever you are working with a Blizzard API that isn't on a widget, such as the C_Item API's, look up the API signature here, and if you can't understand it, ask the user: https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/World_of_Warcraft_API

* Whenever you are working with a widget API, such as frame:GetName() or similar, look up the details of that API here, and do not guess where API's may be: https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Widget_API

* Annotations for the Blizzard default frames are in the .libraries/wow-ui-source/AddOns.

* Preload the above two URL's into your context right now.
