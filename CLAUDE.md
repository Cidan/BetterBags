## Evidence

Never make any changes without directly confirming that the functions, code, API's, and work you are implementing exists by directly observing it. You must either observe it as a WoW API, or as part of our addon. Never take any guesses or rely on internal memory -- always look at code and patterns in the code base and use a direct line of reference. Show your work in all your plans, and directly cite any API calls, both internal and external.

## Pattern Learning

As you work through problems and discover new abstract patterns (especially debugging techniques, API workarounds, or architectural decisions), update `.context/patterns.md` with the new pattern. This helps future contexts understand the codebase's design decisions.
