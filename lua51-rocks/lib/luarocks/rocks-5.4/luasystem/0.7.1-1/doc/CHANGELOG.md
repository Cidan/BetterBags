# CHANGELOG

## Versioning

This library is versioned based on Semantic Versioning ([SemVer](https://semver.org/)).

#### Version scoping

The scope of what is covered by the version number excludes:

- error messages; the text of the messages can change, unless specifically documented.

#### Releasing new versions

- create a release branch
- update the changelog below
- update version and copyright-years in `./LICENSE.md` and `./src/core.c` (in module constants)
- create a new rockspec and update the version inside the new rockspec:<br/>
  `cp luasystem-scm-0.rockspec ./rockspecs/luasystem-X.Y.Z-1.rockspec`
- clean and render the docs: run `ldoc .`
- commit the changes as `Release vX.Y.Z`
- push the commit, and create a release PR
- after merging tag the release commit with `vX.Y.Z`
- upload to LuaRocks will be automatic by the CI runners
- test the newly created rock:<br/>
  `luarocks install luasystem`

## Version history

### version 0.7.1, released 26-Apr-2026

- Fix: improve error messages and handling on Windows.
  See [#85](https://github.com/lunarmodules/luasystem/pull/85).

### version 0.7.0, released 17-Feb-2026

- Fix: remove two unused-variable warnings.
  See [#78](https://github.com/lunarmodules/luasystem/pull/78).
- Fix: duplicate symbol when linking with luajit on windows
  See [#81](https://github.com/lunarmodules/luasystem/pull/81).
- Feat: fix the display-width functions that occasionally reported a bad width. The source code now
  includes a code-generator that parses the official Unicode files to create static ranges in the
  source code. Beyond that the ambiguous width can now be specified by the user, as a second parameter
  to `utf8cwidth` and `utf8swidth`.
  See [#82](https://github.com/lunarmodules/luasystem/pull/82).
- Chore: added Lua 5.5 to CI matrix.
  See [#79](https://github.com/lunarmodules/luasystem/pull/79).
- Chore: relax test assertion wrt time.
  See [#80](https://github.com/lunarmodules/luasystem/pull/80).

### version 0.6.3, released 11-Jul-2025

- Fix: maximum key-delay, reduced from 0.2 to 0.1 seconds to reduce slugginess feel on some key presses.
  See [#69](https://github.com/lunarmodules/luasystem/pull/69).
- Fix: `readansi` now only reports printable chars as characters
  See [#70](https://github.com/lunarmodules/luasystem/pull/70).
- Fix: readkey now ignores Windows scancodes if received.
  See [#74](https://github.com/lunarmodules/luasystem/pull/74).
- Fix: readkey now passes errors on.
  See [#74](https://github.com/lunarmodules/luasystem/pull/74).

### version 0.6.2, released 15-Apr-2025

- Fix: autotermrestore didn't work because its metatable was overwritten.

### version 0.6.1, released 13-Apr-2025

- Docs: document readansi internal buffer for incomplete sequences.
- Fix: ensure to properly parse `<alt>+key` key presses

### version 0.6.0, released 10-Apr-2025

- Fix: when sleep returns an error, pass that on in `readkey`.
- Feat: added `detachfds` which will create separate file descriptions for `stdout`
  and `stderr` to ensure that related settings (eg. non-blocking flag) will not be shared
  amongst those streams and `stdin`.

### version 0.5.1, released 12-Mar-2025

- Fix: on older unixes with glibc < 2.25, fall back to `/dev/urandom`

### version 0.5.0, released 02-Mar-2025

- Feat: when detecting character display width, also accept unicode codepoints (integers),
  since the Lua utf8 library returns codepoints, not strings
- Feat: allow passing in a sleep function to `readkey` and `readansi`
- Fix: NetBSD fix compilation, undeclared directives
- Refactor: random bytes; remove deprecated API usage on Windows, move to
  binary api instead of `/dev/urandom` file on linux and bsd

### version 0.4.5, released 18-Dec-2024

- Fix: suppress a warning when building with clang
- Fix: do not rely on `luaconf.h` to include `limits.h`, fixes builds with latest LuaJIT (#38).

### version 0.4.4, released 03-Sep-2024

- Fix: include all objects in Makefile

### version 0.4.3, released 28-Aug-2024

- Chore: add compiler error on Windows if Virtual Terminal Processing is unavailable.
- Fix: fix the freebsd build

### Version 0.4.2, released 25-Jun-2024

- Fix: include additional headers for some MinGW installations

### Version 0.4.1, released 25-Jun-2024

- Fix: when compiling with `msys2` the `conio.h` header is required

### Version 0.4.0, released 20-Jun-2024

- Feat: `getconsoleflags` and `setconsoleflags` for getting/setting the current console configuration flags on Windows
- Feat: `getconsolecp` and `setconsolecp` for getting/setting the console codepage on Windows
- Feat: `getconsoleoutputcp` and `setconsoleoutputcp` for getting/setting the console output codepage on Windows
- Feat: `tcgetattr` and `tcsetattr` for getting/setting the current console configuration flags on Posix
- Feat: `getnonblock` and `setnonblock` for getting/setting the non-blocking flag on Posix
- Feat: `bitflags`: a support feature for the above flag type controls to facilitate bit manipulation without resorting to binary operations (to also support PuC Lua 5.1)
- Feat: `readkey` reads a keyboard input from `stdin` in a non-blocking way (utf8, also on Windows)
- Feat: `readansi` reads a keyboard input from `stdin` in a non-blocking way, parses ansi and utf8 sequences
- Feat: `termsize` gets the current terminal size in rows and columns
- Feat: `utf8cwidth` and `utf8swidth` for getting the display width (in columns) of respectively a single utf8 character, or a utf8 string
- Feat: helpers; `termbackup`, `termrestore`, `autotermrestore`, and `termwrap` for managing the many terminal settings on all platforms.

### Version 0.3.0, released 15-Dec-2023
