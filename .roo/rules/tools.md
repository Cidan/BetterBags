# Tools

Always use the "wow-api" MCP server and it's tools when editing any lua code and API interations, as it contains the documentation for the WoW API.

Make sure when using the tools to specific the correct version.

* Era is the "vanilla" WoW client
* Classic is "mists"
* Everything else is "mainline"
