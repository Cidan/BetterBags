# Features

## Three Bag & Bank Views
BetterBags offers its users three powerful and distinctly different bag views, which also carry over to the bank.  

### One Bag
A simple and clean one bag window that holds all your items.

<div align="center" style="text-align:center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Gu5a3x9.png" alt="One Bag View in Retail.">

</div>

### Section Grid
This view sorts your inventory into their own visually distinct categories, allowing you to categorize items at a basic level that is easier for humans to understand by grouping like items together. 

The Section Grid offers:
- Customizable columns and number of items per row.
- Categories can be sorted either alphabetically (top to bottom), size descending, or size ascending.
- Categories can be pinned to the top and enabled or disabled at will.
- Items within these categories can be sorted alphabetically and then by quality (or vice versa).
- Multiple stacking options for fine-tuning your own experience.

### List View
The List view provides a simple scrolling list with items sorted into the same distinct categories as the Section Grid view.

## Bank
### Bank Tabs
BetterBags displays the different types of bank as tabs along the bottom of the bank window. It also includes the option to purchase the Reagent Bank and any available Warband Bank tabs.  
Tabs include:
- Bank (Showing all base bank slots as well as bank bags).
- Reagent Bank
- Warband Bank Tabs 1-5 (Called `Warbank Tab` in BetterBags)

## Plugin System
BetterBags has a robust plugin system that allows developers to write custom categories.

Plugins have the following options:
- Custom Category API, to create new categories through the plugin.
- Config Module API, allowing plugin authors to let users fine-tune their own experience.
- Localization module, which allows the plugin author to localize their text.

## Recent Items
BetterBags places items that have been flagged as new by the WoW client in a special category at the top of your bag so that you can quickly find these looted items.  
**Note: To clear recent items manually, right-click the bag icon. On Cataclysm and Classic, you must install the [SortBags Addon](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/sortbags) to manually clear recent items.**

These can be further fine-tuned by:
- Setting a custom duration before they are sorted into their categories.
- Marking **all** items as recent (bank --> bag transfer, opening containers, etc.).
- Flashing new items in the stack to help the user find updated stacks more quickly.

## Search
BetterBags offers a comprehensive Search option that can be toggled with a keybinding (`BetterBags > Search Bags`).

By default searches are done in a prefix style, meaning the things you are searching for must start with what you type. To support full-text searching of each field, use the `%=` operator. If you do not specify a search index, search will default to searching in all of `name`, `type`, `subtype`, `category`, and `equipmentLocation`.  
Search allows you to find items by (based on the item below):
